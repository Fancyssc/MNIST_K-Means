# MNIST_K-Means
Using K-Means to do clustering on MINST with some improved algorithms.

## Configuration
**Package needed:**

scikit-learn

matplotlib

pytorch

numpy

**program configuration:**

The paths in the programs are relative path. If needed, you do need to use the abosulte path. Otherwise, the program could be run directly.
## Program Utils and Structures
### K-Means
Basic K-Means class, involved by other classes.

### Clusters
directory containning pure K-Means, K-Means with smoothing using Gaussian filter, K-Means with USM and K-Means with Canny.

### Clusters/Analysis
directory containning time cosuming analysis, elbow method and visualization using PCA and t-SNE.

### Classification
Classify MNIST using FC, CNN and Decision Tree.

### data
MNIST dataset--->You do not need to download MNIST online.

### Figure
Analysis figures.
